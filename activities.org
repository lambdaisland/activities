* Things you can try yourself
** Styling
   Ring has a middleware for serving up static files (e.g. css), and I think
   it's even included in the default middlewares.

   - Create a resources/public/styles.css file
   - Figure out at which URL you can access it
   - Try to reference it from :html :head

** Refactor the handlers
   Create a ~response~ function that

   - Sets the status code to 200
   - Sets the content type header
   - calls layout, hiccup, str
   - Bonus points: allow overriding status code, adding extra headers
   - Bonus bonus: set the title in the layout with a {:layout} option
   - Bonus bonus bonus: allow the options map to be omitted

   #+begin_src clojure
     (response {:status ... :headers ... :title ...}
               [:some :hiccup])

     (response [:some :hiccup])
   #+end_src

** Add crux ;)

   After going through the tutorial, see if you can add it in.

   Just hack it in however you like, or if you want to be fancy add it to
   system.edn and add a integrant/init-key method

** Easier one: add description field

   Give activities a description text field, render it nicely

   Bonus: allow markdown, maybe look at Flexmark

   Other fields: begin and end time, maximum number of participants


* Databases
- Datomic
  Pros: very idiomatic, good to learn about, easy to use
  Cons: high memory footprint, not free software, commercial version expensive

- Crux
  Pros: great data model, very Clojure-y, bitemporal
  Cons: not very mature yet

- PostgreSQL / RDBMS / JDBC
  Pros: very easy to set up, cheap to run, well understood
  Cons: relational model, more work converting to/from Clojure data

- Firebase
  ... would have to be investigated ...

- Spicerack -> MapDB
  Pros: probably easiest upgrade path from atom
  Cons: not really production ready
